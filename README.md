# GAIDeT Declaration Generator

This is a **beta version** of the <a href="https://panbibliotekar.github.io/gaidet-declaration/">GAIDeT Declaration Generator</a> — an interactive HTML tool that helps researchers transparently disclose the use of Generative AI (GAI) tools in scientific writing and research.
The declaration is based on the **GAIDeT taxonomy** (Generative AI Delegation Taxonomy), developed to promote transparency and accountability in academic publishing. 
We recommend presenting the generated statement as a separate section immediately following the CRediT authorship contributions, in line with the model proposed in our manuscript. This ensures clear delineation between human and AI contributions in the research workflow.

## 🧪 How it works

The GAIDeT Declaration Generator is an interactive HTML tool that helps researchers declare the use of generative AI in scientific writing and publishing. Here's how to use it:

1. Fill in the name of the responsible author  
   *(or enter “Collective responsibility” if all authors share responsibility)*

2. Specify which version of the LLM was used
   *(e.g., ChatGPT-4.5, Claude 3, Gemini 1.5)*

3. Select the relevant research and writing tasks  
   *(based on the GAIDeT taxonomy of delegable tasks)*

4. Optionally, add a short comment for clarification

5. Click **“Generate”** to create a declaration that can be copied into the Methods, Acknowledgments, or CRediT section of a manuscript, or it could be supplied as a new and separate GAI use statement.
